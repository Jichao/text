[section Configuration]

_thread_unsafe_m_ is a macro that controls whether the reference counts on _r_
nodes.  Define it to be a nonzero value if you want to use non-atomic
reference counts for better single-threaded performance.

You can define _string_max_m_ to be the size in bytes that you want as the
limit on the size of _ur_ and _r_ nodes when doing in-place insertions.
