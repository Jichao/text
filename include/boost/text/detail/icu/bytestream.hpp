//
// Abstract interface that consumes a sequence of bytes (ByteSink).
//
// Used so that we can write a single piece of code that can operate
// on a variety of output string types.
//
// Various implementations of this interface are provided:
//   ByteSink:
//      CheckedArrayByteSink    Write to a flat array, with bounds checking
//      StringByteSink          Write to an STL string

// This code is a contribution of Google code, and the style used here is
// a compromise between the original Google code and the ICU coding guidelines.
// For example, data types are ICU-ified (size_t,int->int32_t),
// and API comments doxygen-ified, but function names and behavior are
// as in the original, if possible.
// Assertion-style error handling, not available in ICU, was changed to
// parameter "pinning" similar to UnicodeString.
//
// In addition, this is only a partial port of the original Google code,
// limited to what was needed so far. The (nearly) complete original code
// is in the ICU svn repository at icuhtml/trunk/design/strings/contrib
// (see ICU ticket 6765, r25517).

         * *result_capacity>=min_capacity. May return a pointer to the
         * caller-owned scratch buffer which must have
         * scratch_capacity>=min_capacity.
         * The returned buffer is only valid until the next operation
         * on this ByteSink.
         *
         * After writing at most *result_capacity bytes, call Append() with the
         * pointer returned from this function and the number of bytes written.
         * Many Append() implementations will avoid copying bytes if this
         * function returned an internal buffer.
         *
         * Partial usage example:
         *  int32_t capacity;
         *  char* buffer = sink->GetAppendBuffer(..., &capacity);
         *  ... Write n bytes into buffer, with n <= capacity.
         *  sink->Append(buffer, n);
         * In many implementations, that call to Append will avoid copying
         * bytes.
         *
         * If the ByteSink allocates or reallocates an internal buffer, it
         * should use the desired_capacity_hint if appropriate. If a caller
         * cannot provide a reasonable guess at the desired capacity, it should
         * pass desired_capacity_hint=0.
         *
         * If a non-scratch buffer is returned, the caller may only pass
         * a prefix to it to Append().
         * That is, it is not correct to pass an interior pointer to Append().
         *
         * The default implementation always returns the scratch buffer.
         *
         * @param min_capacity required minimum capacity of the returned buffer;
         *                     must be non-negative

         *                              must be non-negative
         * @param scratch default caller-owned buffer
         * @param scratch_capacity capacity of the scratch buffer
         * @param result_capacity pointer to an integer which will be set to the
         *                        capacity of the returned buffer
